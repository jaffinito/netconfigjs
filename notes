Creates objects
All xs:element objects are arrays
Start on first element since that is the configuration element.
each top level object in the "array" is named after its number
	0 or 1 or 2 etc...
Same goes for attributes
Most items are arrays in fact.
Should be able to get size if needed.

for elements the name is store under a "$" object beneath the array number object
for attributes this same object store the name and all other key/value pairs.

You can run into complextypes and alls but you can just work through the objects at the next level
if attributes are found here they go with the previous element, which shuold still be the active object
if an all or other type is reached then we expand it and repeat.

attribs and elements are always under complextype except root
under complexType we will either see another or all or sequence

xs:restriction is always under xs:simpleType under an xs:attribute
contains xs:enumeration with valuez
